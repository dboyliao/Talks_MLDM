# OpenCV on iOS - A Simple Demo on Edge Computing

`Edge Computing`, according to the definition from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing), is "pushing the frontier of computing applications, data, and services away from centralized nodes to the logical extremes of a network".


Seriously, are you speaking ENGLISH?

To be specific and concrete, I'll use OpenCV and construct a neural network which can run on an iphone in this demo project.

I'll show you how to make good use of (a.k.a mess up) `C++`, `Obj-C++` and `Swift` working hand in hand (I lied) in one project.

## Prerequisite

- `pod`: a framework manager for iOS project.
- `XCode`
