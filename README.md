# Talks at MLDM Monday

MLDM Monday is a community located in Taipei, Taiwan which aims to promote any topics related to "M"achine "L"earning and "D"ata "M"ining. 

This repo collects some talks (there is only one for now :p) I gave at MLDM Monday weekly meeting.

I hope you enjoy it.

## Project Descriptions

- `OpenCVDemo`: it is a demo project how to use opencv on iOS. This talk aims
                to promote the idea about `Edge Computing`. In my use case, 
                you can do machine learning on mobile device with the help of 
                `OpenCV`. In this demo project, I implement a simple neural 
                network which can be used to solve classification problem.
